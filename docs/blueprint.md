## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Golden yellow (#FFC107) to evoke a sense of classical antiquity and enlightenment.
- Background color: Pale sand (#F5F5DC), creating a warm, papyrus-like texture to reduce eye strain and offer historical grounding.
- Accent color: Aegean blue (#0077CC), drawing a connection to the Greek seas and skies, and offering visual contrast for interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Gentium', a clear serif font (requested by the user) for enhanced readability of Ancient Greek text. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use simple, vector-based icons to represent grammar concepts or topic categories (e.g., a lyre for 'myth', a house for 'daily life').
- Employ a clean, intuitive layout with clearly defined sections for the Greek text, illustrations, and glosses to support structured learning.
- Incorporate subtle animations for interactive elements, such as slide-in glosses or page transitions, to enhance user engagement without distraction.
