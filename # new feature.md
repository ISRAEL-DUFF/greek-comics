# new feature

let's implement a word expansion feature. it should work like this:
Given any greek word:
if the word is a verb:
  i. Give it's gloss
  ii. Generate it's principle parts
  iii. generate it's full conjugation paradigms
  iv. Give a detailed Etymology of the word

if the word is a participle:
  i. Identify the verb it is derived from
  ii. Generate the verb's principle parts
  iii. generate the full declension paradigms for the participle (including the translations of the participle)
  iv. Give a detailed Etymology of the word
  v. Give a detailed description of the participle's usage in a sentence

if the word is a noun
  i. Give it's gloss
  ii. Generate full declension paradigm
  iii. Give a detailed etymology of the word including it's root/stem

if the word is an adjective:
  i. Give it's gloss
  ii. Generate full declension paradigm
  iii. Give a detailed etymology of the word including it's root/stem
  iv. Give a detailed description of the adjective's usage in a sentence

if other type of word:
  i. Describe the word
  ii. Give a detailed etymology of the word including it's root/stem
  iii. Give a detailed description of the word's usage in a sentence


the above word details should be given in markdown so it's easy to modify and display paradigm tables appropriately.
Since the output is markdown, the feature should be able to display markdown effectively.

Implement a way to save the generated detail to an API and It should be able to list and display previously generated words





great job so far.
let's now implement an intelligent search functionality:
given a greek word, it should search expanded_word markdown column and return all rows that contains the given word so the user can click to view full detail, just as we have it in the history section. you might want to consider implementing as a modal so you can maintain the state of the search. the modal should be launched when a button is clicked on the main page.

great job.
consider a case where a user may have many words to expand, this means the user will have to do it one at a time which maybe time consuming and sometimes frustrating.
let's implement a feature that allows a user expand multiple words (maybe separated by comma). this will make the app more flexible.
ensure that in this feature, the AI flow is exactly the same output and format as the single flow so that the generated content doesn't become inconsistent.

nice job.
if we look at the history section we find that when the words in the db becomes very large, then the history sections won't be efficient in terms of UI/UX. how should we deal with that?


but what criteria are we filtering with?

it's probably better to implement something like an index table that categorizes the words into sections based on the 1st alphabet of the word. e.g, all alpha words go in the alpha index, all beta words into beta index etc. that way, the user is able to navigate while still being able to filter.



now that we have the expansion tool ready, how do we add words to our collection directly from the story page? the user might be interested in a particular word while reading the story, how do we enable the user expand a word in the story?
